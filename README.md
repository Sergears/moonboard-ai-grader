Artificial intelligence grader for Moonboard boulder problems

Moonboard is a standartized training wall for rock climbers. A boulder problem is created by choosing the allowed holds. It then gets graded and repeated by users worldwide.

This repository contains a streamlit web app that lets you select any boulder problem from the test set. The problem will be graded by the already trained neural networks (regressor and classifier) and a random forest model.
